## Recommendations


* Coinbase should support trading of different types of cryptos. Additionally, Coinbase needs to offer it's service in more than currently supported 32 countires. Cryptocurrencies are extremly volatile and lauching other products such as crypto indices, futures trading on their indices, OTC forward rate agreements & swaps, etc... as risk management tools for institutional users. With the above 2 in place, crypto currency exchange should work through the regulations to make the products fungible or assure they stay fungible. This will allow market place to trade with a lot more efficiency.


*  With the addition of such tools Coinbase can offer margin benefits as well to the institutional players thus reducing the capital requirements and fusing more captial back into markets for further trading. Financial markets loves to exploit inefficiences that will occur due to it's expansion around the globe. It will help the company with more liquidity and goal it set out with to achieve.

* As the exchange grows in liquidity of cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency becomes more mainstream volatility will bring in more volumes. Use of ILink Architecture and Market Segment Gateways could be of great help for the future. ILink infrastrucutre helps in the reduction of response time and is able to process the matching order with great speed. Market Segment Gateways would help with providing First in First Out message ordering. It would also help with elimination of variability associated with multiple sessions across multiple gateways connecting to the matching engine. It also means the supporting algorithms needs to work in sync to excute the sophistication.
